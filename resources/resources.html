              Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It
              can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming
              platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at
              scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted.

              When you experience cyberbullying you might start to feel ashamed,
              nervous, anxious and insecure about what people say or think about
              you. This can lead to withdrawing from friends and family,
              negative thoughts and self-talk, feeling guilty about things you
              did or did not do, or feeling that you are being judged
              negatively. Feeling lonely, overwhelmed, frequent headaches,
              nausea or stomachaches are also common.You can lose your
              motivation to do the things that you usually enjoy doing and feel
              isolated from the people you love and trust. This can perpetuate
              negative feelings and thoughts which can adversely affect your
              mental health and well-being.
